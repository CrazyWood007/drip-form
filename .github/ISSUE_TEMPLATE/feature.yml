        If you answered the question above as "no" because you feel like you could contribute directly to our repo, please check the box below. This would tell us and other people looking for contributions that someone's working on it.
        If you do check this box, please send a pull request within 7 days after a maintainer's approval so we can still delegate this to someone else.

        Note that for feature issues, we still require you to fully fill out this form and reach consensus with the maintainers on API design before rushing to implement it, so that you don't waste your time.
      options:
        - label: I'd be willing to contribute this feature to DripForm myself.
